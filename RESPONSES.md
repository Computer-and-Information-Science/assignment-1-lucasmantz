## factorial2.cpp

1. 
The number that affects number of calls is the int you input, which is the factorial you are trying to find.

2. 
input = 7, count = 8
input = 10, count = 11
input = 15, count = 16

3. 
Function is n + 1

## ireverse2.cpp

1. 
The number that affects number of calls is the number of digits in your input. Therefore, if your number is in the hundreds (ex. 123), then the recursive function will be called three times.

2. 
input = 456 (output = 654), count = 3
input = 1234 (output = 4321), count = 4
input = 45678 (output = 87654), count = 5

3. 
Assuming x = the number of digits in the number, function is x.
